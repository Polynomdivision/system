System - My dotfiles using Ansible
===
Why? I can't write bash scripts that **actually** work.

## Structure
- setup_desktop.yml: Dotfiles, packages and settings for my desktop linux (Arch Linux)
- setup_netbook.yml: Dotfiles, packages and settings for my netbook linux (Arch Linux)
- arch_setup.sh: A script which installes Arch Linux and uses one of the playbooks above

## Setup
**DON'T** use the installation script. I take no responsibility if anyone actually uses this script.
